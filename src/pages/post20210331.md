Well, I might have here a portfolio site with no portfolio, and design looking like one of hte first sites I built 20+ years ago, but in the process today I submitted my first pull request!! I had 5 or so years off of learning to program while I went back to school for very non-programming things, but the mystery of the pull request finally revealed itself at some point over my intensive learning process in the past year. It all made sense.

Thank to gatsby for having an open-source focus, today I was able to link onwards in the tutorial, as well as fix a few typos, and submit two whole PRs for documentation. Do I know why the CircleCI tests failed on one and not the other? I do not, but I have a guess: the failing PR referred back to the site itself: the relative link I needed led to a 404, so I used an absolute link, which is a no-no in the contributor guidelines and is probably a no-no for the tests as well. But we shall see! I'm happy to contribute in some small way, to keep Gatsby spit n polished, but I hope i can contribute to the codebase some day...even though that still seems like an impossible thing!
