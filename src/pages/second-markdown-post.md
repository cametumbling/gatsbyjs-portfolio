title: "Cult of Dave...!?!?"

As a massive dork, my pandemic social life consists solely of zoom drawing get-togethers, where we all follow along a youtube drawing tutorial and take a group photo holding up our work at the end. It's lovely.

But one day, the tutorial of a tiger did not go so well for one of group. "Dave," as she called him, wound up looking more than a bit wonky, and has been a source of much hilarity ever since. So much so that now, almost a year later, we are all ordering shirts with Dave's glorious visage.

It was proposed that we start a Cult of Dave, and roles were apportioned -- High Preistess, for example. Rather boringly, I was appointed webmaster, and immediately attempted to purchase cultofdave dot com.

Only to find...

How can this be real? The Cult of Dave website already exists...and is the best thing ever. The cultishness is spot on. It even has its own philosophy and terminology. Except, sadly, it is not actually the best thing ever...secret links go not to social media sites, but to right wing nutso propaganda, which is sad.
