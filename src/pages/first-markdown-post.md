As you can read on my about page, I have a postgraduate degree in Assyriology (M.Phil. Cuneiform Studies) from the University of Oxford in the UK.

That's a pretty niche thing, so I get several random questions a year sent my way via social media. I'm happy to answer them, and generally research my answers to make sure I'm giving up-to-date information. Assyriology is a young and small field, and interpretations are always shifting!

The most popular question I recieve is in reference to the large beaked and/or winged figures in the Assyrian Palace Reliefs from the early first millenium BCE. These _apkallu_ as they are called in the ancient language of Akkadian, are holding small baskets, and aloft they are holding what appear to be pinecones. They are placed next to the king and what appears to be a small tree. They are the most frequent characters to appear on the reliefs, yet their role--and, perhaps more importantly, the significance of the tree--is still contested by scholars.

In this article I will contextualize these reliefs historically and geographically, then I will discuss the various interpretations of this scene, and finally, I shall leave off with my concluding analysis.
